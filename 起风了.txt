起风了 - 大柯&小忆za

作词：米果

作曲：高桥优

这一路上走走停停

顺着少年漂流的痕迹

迈出车站的前一刻

竟有些犹豫

不禁笑这近乡情怯

仍无可避免

而长野的天

依旧这么暖

风吹起了从前

从前初识这世间

万般流连

看着天边似在眼前

也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍

如今走过这世间

万般流连

翻过岁月不同侧脸

措不及防闯入你的笑颜

我曾难自拔于世界之大

也沉溺于其中梦话

不得真假不做挣扎不惧笑话

我曾将青春翻涌成她

也曾指尖弹出盛夏

心之所动且就随缘去吧

逆着光行走任风吹雨打

短短的路走走停停

也有了几分的距离

不知抚摸的是故事

还是段心情

也许期待的不过是

与时间为敌

再次看到你

微凉晨光里

笑的很甜蜜

从前初识这世间

万般流连

看着天边似在眼前

也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍

如今走过这世间

万般流连

翻过岁月不同侧脸

措不及防闯入你的笑颜

我曾难自拔于世界之大

也沉溺于其中梦话

不得真假不做挣扎不惧笑话

我曾将青春翻涌成她

也曾指尖弹出盛夏

心之所动且就随缘去吧

晚风吹起你鬓间的白发

抚平回忆留下的疤

你的眼中明暗交杂一笑生花

暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐

走进床头藏起的画

画中的你低着头说话

我仍感叹于世界之大

也沉醉于儿时情话

不剩真假不做挣扎无谓笑话

我终将青春还给了她

连同指尖弹出的盛夏

心之所动就随风去了

以爱之名你还愿意吗
The wind is blowing - da ke & xiao yi za
Lyrics: miguel
Composition: takahashi yoyo
The journey was stop-and-go
Following the tracks of the juvenile drifts
A moment before stepping out of the station
Some hesitation
Can't help laughing at this near homesickness
Still inevitable
And the sky in nagano
Still so warm
The wind blows once upon a time
I knew this world for the first time
So reluctant
Looking at the horizon
I would go through fire and water to walk through it
Now through this world
So reluctant
Turn the page
I can't stop smiling at you
I used to be in a world of trouble
And indulged in their dreams
Can not be true or false do not struggle not afraid of jokes
I turned my youth to her
Also once fingertip eject midsummer
Whatever moves the heart, let it be
Walk against the light and let the wind blow and the rain fall
The short road was stop-and-go
It's a little bit further away
I do not know the touching is the story
Or a mood
Maybe I was just looking forward to it
Against time
See you again
In the cool morning light
The smile is sweet
I knew this world for the first time
So reluctant
Looking at the horizon
I would go through fire and water to walk through it
Now through this world
So reluctant
Turn the page
I can't stop smiling at you
I used to be in a world of trouble
And indulged in their dreams
Can not be true or false do not struggle not afraid of jokes
I turned my youth to her
Also once fingertip eject midsummer
Whatever moves the heart, let it be
The evening wind blew the white hairs from your temples
Heal the scars left by memories
The brightness of your eyes mixed with a smile
The dusk covers your faltering steps
Walked into the bed and hid the painting
You're talking with your head down
I still marvel at the size of the world
Also indulge in childhood love
Do not leave true false do not struggle meaningless joke
I will return her youth
Along with the fingertips pop of summer
Whatever moves the heart goes with the wind
Are you willing in the name of love
